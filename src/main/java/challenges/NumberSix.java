     * Create a String representation of the contents of the list that starts at head.
     * The list will only ever contain numbers, as the data inside each node is an integer.
     * You can assume that the value for head will never be null.
     *

     *
     * Example:
     * List: 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5
     * Then head would contain 3 as it's data and another node that would contain 2.
     * printLinkedList returns "3 2 10 5"
     *
     * Example:
     * List: 6 -> 27 -> 45 -> 75
     * Then head would contain 6 as it's data and another node that would contain 27.
     * printLinkedList returns "6 27 45 75"
     *
     * @param head the first element in the list
     * @return the data contents of the list printed in a String with each number separated by a space
